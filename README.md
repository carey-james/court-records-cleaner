# court-records-cleaner
## Goal:
There are publicly available court records, but due to the way they are created, they are dirty and difficult to get insightful metrics from. This cleaner preforms several steps to clean the data for future analysis. In particular, this cleaner is designed to address the freely available Maricopa Co. Eviction data (https://spaces.hightail.com/space/D36ic91aI4/files) but in future should be able to easily adapt to other similar datasets.

This project builds upon the pper criminal justice notebooks from USC.
